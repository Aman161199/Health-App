 # Steps used for Deployment:
 a. Created the ML model and saved it using joblib.<br>
 b. Created app.py and created different API's with respect to the diseases.<br>
 c. Deployed all the API's to Heroku.<br>
 d. At the end combined all the API's in the <u>index.html</u> file and ran it through the Github Pages.<br>
 
 # Steps to run this Project:
 a. Clone the project locally.<br>
 b. Create a virtual environment.<br>
 c. Run the API's folder seperately by install all the dependecies using the command<br>
 `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>
 d. Launch `python app.py` <br>
 e. Run the `index.html` file for looking in the working project.<br>
